# Max Speed Tracker

This is my project for the course [Introduction to mobile device programming](http://imoviles.alumnos.exa.unicen.edu.ar/).

## Assignation

Write an application that uses GPS to keep track of the maximum speed reached.
The application must be able to run without the GUI opened.
The GUI should allow start and stop logging events, clean and get the registry value.
Additionally, the application should persist, somehow the maximum value, and restart it if the mobile device was restarted and the application was running.
